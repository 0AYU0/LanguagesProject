# Programming Languages Project
Choose a programming language in which you have no experience. Working with a partner, practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) to write two programs in the new language: one simple string manipulation program and one program that showcases the strengths of the language. Document your exploration of the language in a zine page, and share your language with the class in a 10 minute presentation. 

### Deliverables 
1.  A program that manipulates a string (details below).

2. Make a small program of your own choice that you believe showcases your chosen language well, or explores some interesting and unique aspect of it.

3. A 1-page reference to be compiled into a class “zine” (details below).

4. 10-minute presentation (7 min presentation + 3 for questions) on assigned date (details below).
