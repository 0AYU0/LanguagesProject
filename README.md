# Programming Languages Project
Choose a programming language in which you have no experience. Working with a partner, practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) to write two programs in the new language: one simple string manipulation program and one program that showcases the strengths of the language. Document your exploration of the language in a zine page, and share your language with the class in a 10 minute presentation. 

### Deliverables 
1.  A program that manipulates a string (details below).
2. Make a small program of your own choice that you believe showcases your chosen language well, or explores some interesting and unique aspect of it.
3. A 1-page reference to be compiled into a class “zine” (details below).
4. 10-minute presentation (7 min presentation + 3 for questions) on assigned date (details below).

#### 1. String Program
Get a sentence or sentences (string) from the user. No matter their initial capitalization scheme, correct the capitalization as needed to make it into standard sentences (ie. where only the first letter of the first word in each sentence is capitalized). For example, the sentence “octoPI are GreAT.” would become “Octopi are great.”

#### 3. Zine guidelines
* Use 2 8.5x11 pages, so when we open the zine, we can see a full page spread about your language. 
* Give us some background information about your programming language:
     - Tell us about the history of this language: when, where, and why was it developed? What are some interesting or notable projects it has been used for? 
    - Tell us about the author or authors of this language. Who are they? Include a photo of the author(s). 
    - What can it be used for? 
    - What is the primary programming paradigm that this language uses?
   - What applications is this language best suited to? Give a specific example.
   - What applications would this language be a poor fit for? Give us an example.
* Be creative and weird about it. Include pictures, doodles, cool fonts, your own handwriting. Make a cartoon about your language if you want to! 
* Above all, make the page informative and give it personality!
