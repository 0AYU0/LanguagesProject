# Programming Languages Project
Choose a programming language in which you have no experience. Working with a partner, practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) to write two programs in the new language: one simple string manipulation program and one program that showcases the strengths of the language. Document your exploration of the language in a zine page, and share your language with the class in a 7 minute presentation. 

### Deliverables
1 page reference to be compiled into a class “zine” due March 21st.
10-minute presentation (7 min presentation + 3 for questions) on assigned date
Getting an environment set up to run a new programming language on your computer can take more time than you expect, and so can writing a program in a new language! This is definitely not a night-before-it’s due project.
