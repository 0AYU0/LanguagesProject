# Programming Languages Project
Choose a programming language in which you have no experience. Working with a partner, practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) to write two programs in the new language: one simple string manipulation program and one program that showcases the strengths of the language. Document your exploration of the language in a zine page, and share your language with the class in a 10 minute presentation. 

### Deliverables due March 21st
1.  1 program that manipulates a string (i.e. a series of characters, i.e. a sentence) in the following way:
  ⋅⋅*Get a sentence or sentences (string) from the user. 
  ⋅⋅*No matter their initial capitalization scheme, correct the capitalization as needed to make it into standard sentences (ie. where only the first letter of the first word in each sentence is capitalized). 
  ⋅⋅* For example, the sentence “octoPI are GreAT.” would become “Octopi are great.” 
  ⋅⋅* (Why do this?  different applications will highlight the features of a language better than others, and this small program will only scratch the surface of your programming language, but seeing the same program in multiple languages will at least allow everyone to compare syntax!)

2. Make a small program of your own choice that you believe showcases your chosen language well, or explores some interesting and unique aspect of it.

3. a 1-page reference to be compiled into a class “zine” due March 21st.


* 10-minute presentation (7 min presentation + 3 for questions) on assigned date
Getting an environment set up to run a new programming language on your computer can take more time than you expect, and so can writing a program in a new language! This is definitely not a night-before-it’s due project.
