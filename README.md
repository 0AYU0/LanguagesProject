# Programming Languages Project
Choose a programming language in which you have no experience. Working with a partner, practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) to write two programs in the new language: one simple string manipulation program and one program that showcases the strengths of the language. Document your exploration of the language in a zine page, and share your language with the class in a 10 minute presentation.

### Deliverables 
1. A program that manipulates a string (details below). **DUE 3/19**
2. A small program of your own choice that you believe showcases your chosen language well, or explores some interesting and unique aspect of it. **DUE 3/26**
3. A 1-page reference to be compiled into a class “zine” (details below). **In-Class Workday on 3/27**
4. An informal presentation in which you go over the information included in your zine page. You will present with your partner after spring break.

#### 1. String Program
Get a sentence or sentences (string) from the user. No matter their initial capitalization scheme, correct the capitalization as needed to make it into standard sentences (ie. where only the first letter of the first word in each sentence is capitalized). For example, the sentence “octoPI are GreAT.” would become “Octopi are great.”
##### TO TURN IN YOUR PROGRAM:
* Create a GitHub Repository for your whole languages project. 
* In that repo, make a file called StringProgram.your_language_suffix
* Link to the repo from the [projects.md](https://github.com/lizzybrooks/LanguagesProject/blob/master/projects.md) file in this repository

#### 3. Zine guidelines
* Use 2 8.5x11 pages, so when we open the zine, we can see a full page spread about your language. 
* Give us some background information about your programming language:
     - Tell us about the history of this language: when, where, and why was it developed? What are some interesting or notable projects it has been used for? 
    - Tell us about the author or authors of this language. Who are they? Include a photo of the author(s). 
    - What can it be used for? 
    - What is the primary programming paradigm that this language uses?
   - What applications is this language best suited to? Give a specific example.
   - What applications would this language be a poor fit for? Give us an example.
* Be creative and weird about it. Include pictures, illustrations, doodles, cool fonts, your own handwriting. Make a [cartoon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/84556/whats-your-favorite-programmer-cartoon) about your language if you want to! 
* Above all, make the page informative and give it personality! 

#### 4. Presentation guidelines
* Talk about the content in your zine page: What is this language all about? Who made it and why? (see zine prompts, above).
* Walk us through your simple string program. How does this code look? 
* Talk about the process for setting up your programming environment. Is this a compiled or an interpreted language? What supplemental tools did you need to install or access in order to work in this language? 
* How was the learning curve in this language? Was it hard to get started and easier after a few days? Was it easy in the beginning and then hard? What challenges did you have to overcome? 
* Anything else? Tell some good stories! 

#### General Guidelines for Partner Work
All work on the shared programs (string manipulation and your custom program) must be done with both partners in the same room (preferably looking at the same screen). You can do as much research and experimentation with the language as you want on your own. This stipulation is in place to preserve the delicate balance of project ownership among partner pairs.

## Tutorials and Resources:
### General Stuff
(I'll build out this list once people have chosen their languages)
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn): Java, Python, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and more.
* [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/): similar list to Code Academy, + Objective C.
* [Railsbridge](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/): Classes and curriculum for Ruby on Rails.
* [Interactive Introduction to Clojure](http://www.tryclj.com/) (Lisp) and for fun, [ClojureScript Koans](http://clojurescriptkoans.com/)

### Ruby
* [Best IDEs for Ruby](https://blog.g2crowd.com/blog/integrated-development-environment-ide/whats-best-ide-ruby-development/)

### Java
* [Download and Install Eclipse](https://beginnersbook.com/2016/04/how-to-install-eclipse-on-mac-os-x/)
* [Code Academy Java tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) is a good starting point. Once you've done that, there are a few built-in tutorials in Eclipse that will help you get oriented in the IDE. 

### Swift
* Install the latest version of X-Code (9.2 at time of writing). It comes with Swift. 

### Go 
* [Here's](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.10.darwin-amd64.pkg) a getting started page. 
* [This](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus) looks like a cool package for using Go with Atom.
* And [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins) is a really long list of recommended IDEs and Text Editor Plugins for Go. 
* Curious about how to make a web application in Go? Check out [this tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/). 

### Python
* The first thing you can do is run Python directly from the command line. [This tutorial](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html) will help you download the latest Python and tell you how to do that. 
* The [Code Academy Python tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) is great for familiarizing yourself with basic syntax.
